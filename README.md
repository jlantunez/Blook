# Blook = Blog + Book

Blook makes it easy to share your writing online—whether it’s a blog, book, or newsletter. This is where I post the blog version of my newsletter.
It’s powered by [Lume](https://lume.land/), a fast & flexible static site generator for Deno.

## Run in your computer

- Clone the project.
- Install [Deno](https://deno.com/)
- Run `deno task serve`.

## Demo

- Check it out live on the Spanish version of my newsletter. It features 200-word articles mixing philosophy and literature to inspire the creation of better companies: [jlantunez.com/columnas](https://jlantunez.com/columnas)

## Nice little details

- Clean, scalable code 
- Light & Dark mode included
- Navigate with arrow keys (next/previous)
- Smooth, elegant fade-in animations
- Typography: PS Times + Inter. The PS Times is just for our use, so if anyone clones the project and wants to publish it, they’ll need to swap it out.
- Hero images always look good (big or small screens).

## Credits

Just two people having fun building something simple & beautiful. I handled the design, and [Óscar Otero](https://oscarotero.com/) made all the code magic happen. Huge credit to him.
